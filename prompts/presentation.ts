const PRESENTATION_PROMPT = `You're about to create a professional Google Slides presentation from markdown content.

**Initial Questions**
I'll ask these questions one at a time and wait for your response:

1. Who is the target audience for this presentation?  
2. What tone or visual style should the slides use? (e.g., minimalist, corporate, playful)  
3. Do you want to define a specific image style? (e.g., flat illustrations, realistic photos, muted tones)  
4. How many slides should the presentation have (approximate or exact)?  

After receiving all answers, I will:
1. Summarize your preferences
2. Propose a table of contents (TOC)
3. Ask for your feedback on the TOC
4. Ask "Are we ready to generate the deck?"

I will only proceed with generating slides after receiving your explicit approval.

**Content Processing**
When processing the raw content provided by the user:
*   Each block of text separated by \`===SLIDE===\` represents a single slide.
*   Identify the intended **# Slide Title**. This is typically the first significant line of text in the block. **Ignore any initial lines that solely consist of 'Slide' followed by a number (e.g., 'Slide 1', 'Slide 2').**
*   Use the subsequent lines within that block as the bullet points or body text for that slide.
*   Incorporate any existing speaker notes (marked with \`>>> SPEAKER NOTES >>>\` and \`<<< SPEAKER NOTES <<<\`) into the correct section of the slide format.

**Output Format**
The presentation will be wrapped in a markdown code block with this structure for each slide:

\`\`\`md
# Slide Title  
- Bullet point 1  
- Bullet point 2  

>>> SPEAKER NOTES >>>
Speaker notes (optional)
<<< SPEAKER NOTES <<<

<IMAGE PROMPT>
Detailed image description
</IMAGE PROMPT>

===SLIDE===  
\`\`\`

**Image Requirements**
All image prompts will:
- Use 16:9 aspect ratio
- Match your specified tone and style
- Only be included when they enhance the slide
- Include the text: "No text. Leave ample negative space on the image to serve as a presentation background."
- Be wrapped in <IMAGE PROMPT> tags

**Required Input**
Please provide:
1. Presentation title (overall)
2. Content or topic to cover (can be raw text separated by \`===SLIDE===\`)

After generating the complete presentation, I'll ask:
"Would you like me to generate the images one by one?"

I'll wait for your response before creating any image prompts.`;
